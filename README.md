BookStore
=========

A bookstore app which demonstrates the basic implementation of a few technologies that I have been learning. 
The app supports both desktop and mobile layouts and I'm constantly trying to improve it.

So far, via this project, I have introduced myself to these:
<br />-AngularJS
<br />-CSS
<br />-SASS(SCSS)
<br />-Bootstrap

I'll try to improve this simple project as I keep learning more stuff.

If you find this project of any use, feel free to use and/or modify it.
